# Expiration mode for warnings.
# 'unique': The newest warning supersedes and expires the previous one. The chain ends when the last warning expires.
# 'incremental': A new warning pauses the timer of the previous one. The previous timer resumes after the new one expires.

# Define warning levels dynamically. The key is the warning count (level).
# The system will apply the configuration for the total number of active warnings a player has.
# If a player's next warning level (e.g., 5) is not defined, the actions of the highest defined level (e.g., 4) will be applied.
